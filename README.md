# csgo-radar-cpp
Hastily coded Radar Hack for CS:GO

This was thrown together in about 30 minutes, and compiles with MinGW (Visual Studio should work too). 
I will not update or maintain this because:

1. I dont't really play CS:GO anymore
2: I don't really use Windows anymore

Feel free to fork and make pull requests though.
